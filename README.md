## About
### Sea foods
My project is called sea foods.
This is a wall where you can see the different dishes of sea foods.
I created it since I noted that in many of the menus in my place don't have sea foods displayed yet they cook and serve them.
The purpose of the app is to ensure that the hotels are more efficient since now they can have their menus online in soft copies hence making their work easier.
